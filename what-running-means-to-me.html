    <div class = "articlebody">
        <p>I walked toward the worn, unassuming field, mask-clad and nervous. I was a new kid in a new school in a new city playing a new sport.</p>
        <p>Not exactly sure where to go, I became a remora, looking for someone to latch onto before a group of what seemed to be my peers started to form around me. The cross-country coach appeared out of nowhere and began to say something about the route we would be running, but this new environment demanded my entire focus. My eyes darted back and forth between the people around me, some clearly runners, others clearly not. I would find out where everyone stood soon.</p>
        <p>Before I knew it, we started running. My quarantine-weakened legs were poorly oiled machines, rusted over and squeaking at every step, shadows of their former soccer glory. I constantly intercepted the beads of sweat rolling down my forehead with the back of my hand, as a layer of moisture began to wrap around the rest of my body. I tried to concentrate solely on the feet in front of me, but the rhythmic cacophony generated by the stampede of runners quickly broke my focus. I began to gasp for air like a drowning man, while my peers floated effortlessly, and it was then that I realized just how far adrift I was.</p>
        <p>When I finished, I felt like I had run more in that practice than I had in my entire life. A deep hatred for running boiled inside of me, fueled by the pain in my legs and the embarrassment of being slow. But despite this anger, I resolved to attend the next practice, knowing well that my determination was stronger than the reluctance of my limbs.</p>
        <p>A few weeks in, a new coach came to practice. He focused on short distances and, like me, was new to the school. After our run, he pulled me aside and asked if I was a sprinter. Not knowing my classification but eager to explore new opportunities, I told him that I was. From then on, I would practice under his coaching, training top speed rather than endurance.</p>
        <p>We started in the weight room. He wanted to build our strength before putting it to use, and had me exercising muscles I didn’t know I had. I was starting over again, but this time my peers and I were in the same boat. They were just as new to it as me. It was there that I first felt like I belonged. Everyone encouraged me. Whether it was to finish the last push-up, do the last set, or run the last lap, they brought out the last drops of strength I didn’t know I had. And the challenge of lifting weights forged bonds that could only be birthed out of shared struggle. Walking home together, silent from fatigue, after sets of excruciating deadlifts was where our connections deepened the most.</p>
        <p>Two years later, I still run.</p>
        <p>The last track meet I went to was poorly organized, and we quickly realized that we would be spending our entire day there. Two years ago, I would have escaped at the first opportunity, but this time I looked forward to spending my day with the team.</p>
        <p>We talked, played games, and indulged in the collective madness that arises from being confined in one spot for too long. We were all floating in the same boat, seeking solace in each other's company.</p>
        <p>But the highlight of that day wasn’t a race I ran, it was the last event of the meet: the 4 by 400.</p>
        <p>That was the distance that athletes at both ends of the distance spectrum had equal claim to, and That was the race where they could team up. Our entire team spread out along the track, making sure that there was no place where our teammates wouldn't hear our cheers. As I watched our school's fastest runners working in unison, an immense sense of community washed over me. Their feet became blurs, pounding the track with inexorable might, and each time they raced past the starting line, a deafening roar of applause erupted like a tidal wave, surging through the crowd. As our team won the race, we not only claimed the title of fastest, but also of loudest with our scream-filled celebration. This was my school.</p>
        <p>I have discovered that my enjoyment of the sport goes far beyond the physical act of running. It's the sense of community that comes with being part of a team that motivates me to show up for practice every day, and the feeling of accomplishment that comes with pushing myself to do better. Running has given me a sense of confidence and drive that extends far beyond the track, and I’m grateful that I persevered through my initial hatred of the sport to discover one of my favorite avocations.</p>
        <p>If this journey has taught me anything, it’s that stepping out of your comfort zone can yield serendipitous rewards.</p>
